    <p>I'm looking to become a Machine Learning Engineer in the future.</p> 
    <p>For now I like to rollerblade and write stories. At the moment I'm completely single, not even dating.</p>
    <p>I'm taking time in this class in order to learn how to better code in different coding languages and probably use these languages in making a website.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ my whole life and my favorite scripture is 1 Nephi 2:16.</p>
